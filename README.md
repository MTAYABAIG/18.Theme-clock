This is a theme clock implementation with dynamic display of time and date using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock includes hour, minute, and second hands that rotate based on the current time. The date is shown with the day of the week and abbreviated month, along with a circular highlight for the day of the month.

The clock supports a toggle button for switching between dark and light modes, modifying the appearance of the clock based on the selected mode. The dark mode is activated by adding a CSS class to the HTML element.

The JavaScript code uses the `Date` object to retrieve the current time and date. The time is updated every second using `setInterval`. The `scale` function is used to convert the time and date values into appropriate rotation angles for the clock hands.

Overall, this theme clock provides a visually appealing and interactive way to display the current time and date in different modes.
